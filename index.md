## Welcome to the page of the furture code master Chilas

This site is made with the purpose of testing my ability to become a furture code master, so I can conquer the world of code.

### A bit about the owner

I am Chilas Dipo and am currently studying computer science at Zealand in NÃ¦stved, where im learning how to code and sell the program I/my group have made.
I have always had an interest in computers which later morphed into a interest for codeing and problem solveing, these go hand in hand since
many mordern problems requires someone with extensive knowledge in code to solve them.

### Code for Hello World

```markdown
public class Hello {
    // psvm
    public static void main(String[] args){
        //sout
        int helle ;
         helle = 23;
        System.out.println(helle);
        System.out.println("Dette virker 123");
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Hej mor");
    }
}
```
