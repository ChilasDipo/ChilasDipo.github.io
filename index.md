## Welcome to the page of the furture code master Chilas

This site is made with the purpose of testing my ability to become a furture code master, so I can conquer the world of code.

### A bit about the owner

I am Chilas Dipo and am currently studying computer science at Zealand in NÃ¦stved, where im learning how to code and sell the program I/my group have made.
I have always had an interest in computers which later morphed into a interest for codeing and problem solveing, these go hand in hand since
many mordern problems requires someone with extensive knowledge in code to solve them.
